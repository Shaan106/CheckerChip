## The gem5 standard library

python/gem5/components/ contains all of the components.

All tutorial work is within /playground/

## make buff notes

`./build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-help` provides all of the debug flags. These would be useful for printing debug statements for example when changing commit source code.

ie for commit: `./build/X86/gem5.opt --debug-flags=Commit _checker/v0.1/hello-world.py`
